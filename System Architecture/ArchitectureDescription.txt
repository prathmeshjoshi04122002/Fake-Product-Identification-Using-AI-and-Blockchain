Description of each component

The system architecture of the Fake Product Identification project is designed to provide a secure
and scalable platform for managing assets. The architecture consists of several layers, each with a
specific set of functions and technologies. Here is an overview of the system architecture:

1. Identity management system: Identity management system is responsible for managing the
identity of users on the Fake Product Identification system. It ensures that users are verified and
authenticated before accessing the system.

2. Application Layer: The application layer is the backend of the Fake Product Identification
system, which handles user requests and performs the necessary business logic. The application
layer is built using Node.js and interacts with the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS via the Web3.js
and IPFS APIs.

3. Smart Contract Layer: The smart contract layer is the layer that handles the smart contracts
on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contracts are written in Solidity and are responsible for
executing the business logic of the Fake Product Identification system platform, such as managing
digital assets, enforcing security, and enforcing business rules.

4. Blockchain Layer: The blockchain layer is the underlying layer of the Fake Product
Identification system platform, which provides a secure and decentralised platform for managing
digital assets. The blockchain layer is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which provides a reliable
and secure way to store and manage digital assets.

5. Decentralised Storage Layer: The decentralised storage layer is the layer that handles the
storage of files on the IPFS network. IPFS provides a secure and decentralised way to store and
access files on the Fake Product Identification system platform, without relying on centralised
servers

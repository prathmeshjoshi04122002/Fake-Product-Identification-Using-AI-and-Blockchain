The proposed system really helps the retail market, manufacturers, and consumers from
counterfeiting products but the system failed when a QR code is taken from a genuine product and
given to a fake product then the product which is sold first become genuine it does not matter it is
a genuine product or fake product but another product is treated as a fake product. Also storing the
supply chain of every product require a huge amount of memory which is going to make this
system expensive. The future work is to implement this model and try to resolve the limitation
such as embedding some material in the product so that when a person tries to take the QR code,
the chip or something will send the signal.
1. Integration with Decentralised Exchanges: Decentralised exchanges (DEXs) are becoming
increasingly popular, and integrating this system with DEXs could provide users with a seamless
and secure way to trade digital assets.
2. Improved Security Features: While the Fake Product System is already designed to be secure,
there is always room for improvement. In the future, the project could be improved with additional
security features, such as multi-factor authentication, biometric authentication, and hardware
wallet support.
3. Enhanced User Experience: The user experience of the Fake Product System can be further
improved by adding more features and improving the existing ones. For example, adding a more
intuitive interface, more advanced trading features, and better integration with other applications.
4. Decentralized Identity Management: As the use of blockchain technology expands, there will
be a growing need for decentralized identity management systems. The Fake Product System
could be expanded to include a decentralized identity management system, which would provide
users with greater control over their digital identities. The future work of Fake Product System is
focused on expanding the functionality and improving the user experience of the platform, while
maintaining the highest levels of security and decentralization

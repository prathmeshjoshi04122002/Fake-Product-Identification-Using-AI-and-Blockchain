The global development of a product or technology always comes with risk factors such as
counterfeiting and duplication, which can affect the company's name, company revenue, and
customer health. There are so many products that exist in the supply chain. To ensure that the
product is real or fake. Because of counterfeit or fake products manufacturers facing the biggest
problem and huge losses. To find the genuineness of the product we can use blockchain
technology.
Blockchain is an arrangement of recording information that makes it troublesome or hard to
change, hack, or cheat the framework. A blockchain is essentially a computerized record of
transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of PC systems on the
blockchain. Each block in the chain contains multiple transactions, and every time a new
transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participantâ€™s
record. The decentralized database managed by the number of participants is known as
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are
recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.
Blockchain technology helps to solve the problem of counterfeiting a product. Blockchain
technology is more secure. Once the product is stored on the network hash code is generated of
that product and it is possible to maintain all transaction records of the product and its current
owner as a chain will be created for that product transactions. All the transaction records will be
stored in the form of blocks in the blockchain. In the proposed system we are assigning a
generated QR code to a particular product and the end customer can scan that QR code to get all
information about that product. After scanning the QR code we can identify that the product is
real or fake.

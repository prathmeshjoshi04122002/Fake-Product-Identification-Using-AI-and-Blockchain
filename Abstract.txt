In recent years, Counterfeit products play an important role in product manufacturing industries.
This affects the companies name, sales, and profit of the companies. Blockchain technology is
used to identification of real products and detects fake products.
Blockchain technology is the distributed, decentralized, and digital ledger that stores transactional
information in the form of blocks in many databases which is connected with the chains.
Blockchain technology is secure technology therefore any block cannot be changed or hacked. By
using Blockchain technology, customers or users do not need to rely on third-party users for
confirmation of product safety.
In this project, with emerging trends in mobile and wireless technology, Quick Response (QR)
codes provide a robust technique to fight the practice of counterfeiting the products. counterfeit
products are detected using a QR code scanner, where a QR code of the product is linked to a
Blockchain. So this system may be used to store product details and generated unique code of that
product as blocks in the database. It collects the unique code from the user and compares the code
against entries in the Blockchain database. If the code matches, it will give a notification to the
customer, otherwise it will give the notification to the customer that the
product is fake.
